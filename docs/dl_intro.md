# Data Lake Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of data management, a common challenge emerges: the proliferation of diverse and sometimes **overlapping terminology**. As organizations strive to harness the **power of data** for informed decision-making, they encounter a large set of terms like **data lake, data warehouse, data mart, data fabric, data lake house**, and many more. These terms often represent distinct concepts, but their boundaries can blur, causing **confusion** and miscommunication among data professionals and stakeholders. Hence, a comprehensive reference terminology seems sensible to not only define these concepts but also establish clear boundaries and relationships among them. A summary reference table is provided in the Table below. 

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Data Lake** |- Central and reliable repository to store and process large amounts of data, which can be structured (relational databases), semi-structured (CSV, JSON), unstructured (documents, e-mails) or **binary** (images, audio, video). It is able to store data in its **native format** and process multiple data types;<br/> - Can be deployed on premises or in the cloud (e.g. Amazon, Microsoft, Google); - Intended for **general analysis** and **reports** from raw/massive data (**data scientists** using AI techniques and languages such as SQL, Python, R); - Simple architecture (James Dixon): Hadoop File System (**HDFS**) with lots of folders/files;<br/> - Media and entertainment sector typically uses data lakes to improve its recommendation system;<br/> - **Pros**: High availability, fast access and processing, relatively cheap (cost/size); - **Cons**: Limited quality and data governance
